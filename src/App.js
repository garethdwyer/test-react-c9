        <About about="Iâ€™m Chelsea and I am a novice developer currently honing my skills in order to become a proficient full-stack web developer. 
                      After spending some time in a variety of industries and different businesses, I realised that almost every business requires a solid IT infrastructure in order to be successful. I also noted that almost every business can increase its efficiency and profitability by building the necessary systems and leveraging off software opportunities.
                      The creative satisfaction that I get from building solutions that allow businesses to thrive, while also constantly improving the valuable skillset that is web-development, I look forward to having the opportunity to join a fun and energising work environment where I can continue to learn and grow within a team of like-minded individuals."
